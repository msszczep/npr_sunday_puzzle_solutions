Using code to solve the NPR Sunday Puzzle

Welcome.  This is my repository of computer code attempts to solve the [NPR Sunday Puzzle](https://www.npr.org/series/4473090/sunday-puzzle).

Programs are organized in the `src` directory by language -- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [the Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language), or C Shell.

Data used in programs reside in the `resources` directory.

[I gave a talk in 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cNrmV4Syf4) about some of the puzzles and their solution attempts in Clojure.
